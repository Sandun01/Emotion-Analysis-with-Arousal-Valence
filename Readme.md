# Emotional Arousal
Emotional Arousal is a state of heightened physiological activity.  This includes having strong emotions like anger and fear and we go to the emotional arousal state in response to our daily experiences.  For example the fight, flight or freeze response is a state of emotional arousal.
Some people come into this world with their emotional arousal response on high alert.  For others it takes a lot to trigger their emotional arousal response.  However we come into this world, our emotional arousal isnâ€™t set in stone.  It develops throughout our life.  Arousal starts with a Nature component as a hardwired response to our experiences.  That emotional arousal then develops over time as a reaction to a lifetime of experiences.
There are a number of factors that influence the development of our emotional arousal, including Attachment Styles and Relational Feedback Loops
